# Cutter patch notes

Newest first. Every change says what it does, how to use it, and how it works
underneath. Kept up to date with each commit.

## Edit again (2-hour window)
**What:** After a talking video is made, you can reopen it from Posts and fix
captions, cuts or music without redoing everything.
**Use it:** Posts → the video → "Edit again · 1h 40m left". Fix it, Approve.
**How:** The recording, listen results and edits are kept 2 hours (`madeAt`,
`EDIT_WINDOW_MS`), then deleted. Re-making sends a new post (`id~2`) and rejects
the old one first (also pulls it from Postiz if scheduled). Already posted → the
edit goes out as a new post, and says so.
**Not yet:** reaction/montage/batch/joined videos; excluding one picture.
Files: `store.ts`, `CampaignApp.tsx`, `PostsView.tsx`.

## Wide clips become 9:16 (Meta glasses)
**What:** Landscape (or 3:4) clips are turned into 9:16 automatically.
**Use it:** Settings → Wide clips: Fill (crop, default) / Fit (whole picture over
a blurred copy) / Off. Clips already 9:16 are never touched.
**How:** Size read from the container's display size (rotation applied), 1%
tolerance. Blur is a downscale/upscale (no canvas filter, which some Safari lack).
Fill outputs the biggest 9:16 crop, no upscaling. Files: `framing916.ts`, `render.ts`.

## Outlined headlines
**What:** Headlines default to outline style; outline colour and width are settable.
**How:** `look.ts` Headline.outlineColor/outlineWidth, drawn by `overlay.ts`.

## Pause and daily limits
**What:** Pause a platform or account, or cap posts per day; nothing is lost.
**Use it:** Settings → Posting limits.
**How:** Server `limits.ts`: paused/over-cap posts are marked held (`paused`/`cap`) and
released by the 5-minute tick when free. Files: `postiz/limits.ts`, `PostingLimits.tsx`.

## Account linked later gets existing videos
**What:** Linking a new account attaches it to videos already waiting/scheduled.
**Use it:** Checkbox when saving posting setup (on by default; untick to skip).
**How:** `attach.ts` decides per post: has all / add / add to scheduled / too late /
busy / not open.

## No more duplicate uploads
**What:** The same recording is never kept or posted twice.
**How:** Content fingerprint per file (`fingerprint.ts`); hand posts use a
deterministic key `post-<fp>-<campaign>-<day>`; picking the same file again shows
a "skipped" notice.

## Locked down
**What:** Login first; only the existing login (and a backup admin) get in.
**How:** `LoginGate`, own HMAC token login in the `cutter` edge function, 5 wrong
tries → 30-minute lock, `cutter_*` tables closed to anon/authenticated.
Admin password is the `CUTTER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` secret (not set yet).
